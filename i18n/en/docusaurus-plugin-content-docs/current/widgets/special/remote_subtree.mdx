# RemoteSubtree

| Type name | Supports animations | Controlled by default | May contain associated action | Link |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| RemoteSubtree | &cross; | :heavy_check_mark: | &cross; | - |

The `RemoteSubtree` widget is an analogue of the [Subtree](/docs/widgets/special/subtree) widget and has a similar content update mechanics.
But the difference between `RemoteSubtree` and `Subtree` is that `RemoteSubtree` is able to independently initiate a request for its own content
from the server and render it.

The `RemoteSubtree` widget solves the following problems:
- Ability to dynamically load content in cases where you don't want a new widget subtree to be passed from the server as part of an event
- Reducing the size of the initial json layout. For example, when you don't want to include BottomSheet content in the initial layout.

In widget attributes you can pass:
- URL for loading widget content
- Request meta-information (usually this is the http request method)
- List of dependencies for forming the request body similar to [actions](/docs/core_concepts/actions_events)

## Attributes

```dart
final class RemoteSubtreeAttributes
    implements DuitAttributes<RemoteSubtreeAttributes> {
  final Map<String, dynamic>? data;
  final String downloadPath;
  final Map<String, dynamic>? meta;
  final Iterable<ActionDependency> dependencies;

  RemoteSubtreeAttributes({
    required this.downloadPath,
    required this.dependencies,
    this.data,
    this.meta,
  });
```

## Usage

<Tabs groupId="lang">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>
    ```typescript
    RemoteSubtree(
      {
          id: "id",
          attributes: {
              downloadPath: "/some/url/to/download/layout",
              meta: {
                  method: "POST",
              },
              dependencies: [
                  {
                      id: "some_id",
                      target: "some_target"
                  },
              ],
          },
      },
  )
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    ```go
	RemoteSubtree(
		&duit_attributes.RemoteSubtreeAttributes{
			DownloadPath: "/some/url/to/download/layout",
			Meta: map[string]interface{}{
				"method": "POST",
			},
			Dependencies: []*duit_core.ActionDependency{
				{
					Id: "some_id",
					Target: "some_target",
				},
			},
		},
		"id",
	)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
