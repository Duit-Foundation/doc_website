# ElementTreeEntry

An abstract base class representing a node in the Duit element tree.

The `ElementTreeEntry` class serves as the base class for element models. It retains important properties such as the element's type, identifier, and control state, as well as attributes and a presentation controller for managing user interface state and interactions.

```dart
abstract base class ElementTreeEntry<T> {
  final String type, id;
  final bool controlled;
  final String? tag;
  abstract UIElementController<T>? viewController;
  abstract ViewAttribute<T>? attributes;

  ElementTreeEntry({
    required this.type,
    required this.id,
    required this.controlled,
    this.tag,
  });

  Widget renderView();
}
```
