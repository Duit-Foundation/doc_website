# AnimationTrigger

The `AnimationTrigger` enum specifies when the animation will be launched: during widget build or during action execution.

```dart
enum AnimationTrigger {
  /// Triggers when the animation enters the screen.
  onEnter,
  /// Triggers when the action is triggered.
  onAction,
}
```
